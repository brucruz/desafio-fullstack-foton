    subtitle: 'How to Build Habit-Forming Products',
    description: `How do successful companies create products people can’t put down?\n
Why do some products capture widespread attention while others flop?\n
What makes us engage with certain products out of sheer habit?\n
Is there a pattern underlying how technologies hook us?\n
Nir Eyal answers these questions (and many more) by explaining the Hook Model—a four-step process embedded into the products of many successful companies to subtly encourage customer behavior. Through consecutive “hook cycles,” these products reach their ultimate goal of bringing users back again and again without depending on costly advertising or aggressive messaging.\n
Hooked is based on Eyal’s years of research, consulting, and practical experience. \n
He wrote the book he wished had been available to him as a start-up founder—not abstract theory, but a how-to guide for building better products.\n
Hooked is written for product managers, designers, marketers, start-up founders, and anyone who seeks to understand how products influence our behavior. Eyal provides readers with:\n
• Practical insights to create user habits that stick.\n
• Actionable steps for building products people love. \n
• Fascinating examples from the iPhone to Twitter, Pinterest to the Bible App, and many other habit-forming products.`,

    description: `A number-one New York Times bestseller when it was originally published, THE SILMARILLION is the core of J.R.R. Tolkien's imaginative writing, a work whose origins stretch back to a time long before THE HOBBIT.\n
Tolkien considered THE SILMARILLION his most important work, and, though it was published last and posthumously, this great collection of tales and legends clearly sets the stage for all his other writing.\n
The story of the creation of the world and of the the First Age, this is the ancient drama to which the characters in THE LORD OF THE RINGS look back and in whose events some of them, such as Elrond and Galadriel, took part.\n
The three Silmarils were jewels created by Feanor, most gifted of the Elves. Within them was imprisoned the Light of the Two Trees of Valinor before the Trees themselves were destroyed by Morgoth, the first Dark Lord.\n
Thereafter, the unsullied Light of Valinor lived on only in the Silmarils, but they were seized by Morgoth and set in his crown, which was guarded in the impenetrable fortress of Angband in the north of Middle-earth.\n
THE SILMARILLION is the history of the rebellion of Feanor and his kindred against the gods, their exile from Valinor and return to Middle-earth, and their war, hopeless despite all their heroism, against the great Enemy.\n
This second edition features a letter written by J.R.R. Tolkien describing his intentions for the book, which serves as a brilliant exposition of his conception of the earlier Ages of Middle-earth.`,

    description: `A number-one New York Times bestseller when it was originally published, THE SILMARILLION is the core of J.R.R. Tolkien's imaginative writing, a work whose origins stretch back to a time long before THE HOBBIT.\n
Tolkien considered THE SILMARILLION his most important work, and, though it was published last and posthumously, this great collection of tales and legends clearly sets the stage for all his other writing.\n
The story of the creation of the world and of the the First Age, this is the ancient drama to which the characters in THE LORD OF THE RINGS look back and in whose events some of them, such as Elrond and Galadriel, took part.\n
The three Silmarils were jewels created by Feanor, most gifted of the Elves. Within them was imprisoned the Light of the Two Trees of Valinor before the Trees themselves were destroyed by Morgoth, the first Dark Lord.\n
Thereafter, the unsullied Light of Valinor lived on only in the Silmarils, but they were seized by Morgoth and set in his crown, which was guarded in the impenetrable fortress of Angband in the north of Middle-earth.\n
THE SILMARILLION is the history of the rebellion of Feanor and his kindred against the gods, their exile from Valinor and return to Middle-earth, and their war, hopeless despite all their heroism, against the great Enemy.\n
This second edition features a letter written by J.R.R. Tolkien describing his intentions for the book, which serves as a brilliant exposition of his conception of the earlier Ages of Middle-earth.`,

    description: `How do successful companies create products people can’t put down?\n
Why do some products capture widespread attention while others flop?\n
What makes us engage with certain products out of sheer habit?\n
Is there a pattern underlying how technologies hook us?\n
Nir Eyal answers these questions (and many more) by explaining the Hook Model—a four-step process embedded into the products of many successful companies to subtly encourage customer behavior. Through consecutive “hook cycles,” these products reach their ultimate goal of bringing users back again and again without depending on costly advertising or aggressive messaging.\n
Hooked is based on Eyal’s years of research, consulting, and practical experience. \n
He wrote the book he wished had been available to him as a start-up founder—not abstract theory, but a how-to guide for building better products.\n
Hooked is written for product managers, designers, marketers, start-up founders, and anyone who seeks to understand how products influence our behavior. Eyal provides readers with:\n
• Practical insights to create user habits that stick.\n
• Actionable steps for building products people love. \n
• Fascinating examples from the iPhone to Twitter, Pinterest to the Bible App, and many other habit-forming products.`,

    title: 'The Silmarillion',
    description: `A number-one New York Times bestseller when it was originally published, THE SILMARILLION is the core of J.R.R. Tolkien's imaginative writing, a work whose origins stretch back to a time long before THE HOBBIT.\n
Tolkien considered THE SILMARILLION his most important work, and, though it was published last and posthumously, this great collection of tales and legends clearly sets the stage for all his other writing.\n
The story of the creation of the world and of the the First Age, this is the ancient drama to which the characters in THE LORD OF THE RINGS look back and in whose events some of them, such as Elrond and Galadriel, took part.\n
The three Silmarils were jewels created by Feanor, most gifted of the Elves. Within them was imprisoned the Light of the Two Trees of Valinor before the Trees themselves were destroyed by Morgoth, the first Dark Lord.\n
Thereafter, the unsullied Light of Valinor lived on only in the Silmarils, but they were seized by Morgoth and set in his crown, which was guarded in the impenetrable fortress of Angband in the north of Middle-earth.\n
THE SILMARILLION is the history of the rebellion of Feanor and his kindred against the gods, their exile from Valinor and return to Middle-earth, and their war, hopeless despite all their heroism, against the great Enemy.\n
This second edition features a letter written by J.R.R. Tolkien describing his intentions for the book, which serves as a brilliant exposition of his conception of the earlier Ages of Middle-earth.`,

    title: 'Hooked',
    subtitle: 'How to Build Habit-Forming Products',
    description: `How do successful companies create products people can’t put down?\n
Why do some products capture widespread attention while others flop?\n
What makes us engage with certain products out of sheer habit?\n
Is there a pattern underlying how technologies hook us?\n
Nir Eyal answers these questions (and many more) by explaining the Hook Model—a four-step process embedded into the products of many successful companies to subtly encourage customer behavior. Through consecutive “hook cycles,” these products reach their ultimate goal of bringing users back again and again without depending on costly advertising or aggressive messaging.\n
Hooked is based on Eyal’s years of research, consulting, and practical experience. \n
He wrote the book he wished had been available to him as a start-up founder—not abstract theory, but a how-to guide for building better products.\n
Hooked is written for product managers, designers, marketers, start-up founders, and anyone who seeks to understand how products influence our behavior. Eyal provides readers with:\n
• Practical insights to create user habits that stick.\n
• Actionable steps for building products people love. \n
• Fascinating examples from the iPhone to Twitter, Pinterest to the Bible App, and many other habit-forming products.`,
